Welcome to the adventure game! Your goal is to explore rooms, collect items, fight creatures, and survive. Here's a guide to help you get started:

Commands:
move [direction]: Move to another room. Available directions are up, down, left, and right. Use this to navigate through the game world.
look: Examine your current room. This command reveals the room's description, items present, and any creatures lurking nearby.
take [item name]: Pick up an item in the room. For example, type take Sword to add the Sword to your inventory. Note that your inventory has a capacity limit.
display: View your current inventory. This shows the items you're carrying and helps you manage your equipment.
attack: Engage in combat with a creature in the room. Use this command to attack and defeat enemies, but bewareâ€”if your health drops to zero, the game ends.
save: Save your current progress. This allows you to continue from where you left off later.
load: Load a previously saved game.
exit: Exit the game.
Gameplay Tips:
Explore rooms carefully using the look command. You might find valuable items like swords to increase your attack strength or health potions to restore your health.
Plan your inventory management. If your inventory is full, consider dropping less important items to make room for critical ones.
Be cautious when encountering creatures. Save your game frequently to avoid losing significant progress in case of defeat.
Enjoy the adventure.
